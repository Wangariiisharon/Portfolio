            Hi, I'm Sharon Mwangi, a passionate software developer with two years of  <br />
            hands-on experience in building web applications that are dynamic and  <br />
            user-friendly using modern technologies. I specialize in responsive,  <br />
            accessible, and scalable front-end interfaces coupled with potent back-end <br />
            functionality.

            My experience spans the creation of production-level applications<br />
            featuring role-based access control, data visualization, and database<br /> 
            integration. My work emphasizes clean, maintainable code and thoughtful user<br />
            experiences. Fast-paced environments are what I thrive, and I enjoy tackling<br /> 
            challenges head-on, whether it's debugging complex issues or optimizing<br /> 
            performance. I have a knack for breaking down complex problems into manageable <br />
            tasks, ensuring that I deliver high-quality solutions efficiently. 
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 ">
            I am a firm believer in continuous learning and growth. I actively seek opportunities <br />
            to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest industry trends. I am always <br />
            eager to learn new technologies and methodologies that can enhance my development <br />
            process and improve the quality of my work. I am also a strong advocate for  <br />
            collaboration and
